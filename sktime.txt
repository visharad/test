In forecasting, past data is used to make temporal forward predictions of a time series. This is notably different from tabular prediction tasks supported by scikit-learn and similar libraries.
sktime provides a common, scikit-learn like interface to a variety of classical and ML-style forecasting algorithms, together with tools for building pipelines and composite machine learning models, including temporal tuning schemes, or reductions such as walk forward applications of scikit learn regressors.
